# Intro to Differential Equations
DE are used in expressions where one needs to represent a quantity that is changing w.r.t to some other quantity ( like time ).

---

Must know things:
- Order of DE
- Degree of DE
- Linear vs Non-Linear :star:
- Homogeneous vs Non-Homogeneous :star:

## Linear vs Non-Linear
### Linear
A DE is linear in y if we can write it in a form where 
- in front of y and it's derivatives, pure funcs of x
- y and it's derivatives are all to the 1^(st) power.
