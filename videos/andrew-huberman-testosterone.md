# The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone and Estrogen

- Salutogenic vs Pathogenic Models
- Keeping in mind the positive effect of things help drive us in the correct direction with even more force.

## Sex Steroids - Test and Est

- Present in everybody, differs in the ratio of different genders.
- Profound effects on the body and mind.

### Where do they come from?

- Major sources: Ovaries and Testis (adrenals can also make test.)
- There are sources that produce enzymes, in particular the aromatase. This enzyme is responsible for converting male hormones into females hormones.

### Levels?

- Pre pubescent girls have very low estrogen. ***Estradiol*** is the most active form of estrogen.
- Going into puberty, estrogen sky rockets.
- Estrogen dips after menopause.
- Similarly, test is low before puberty.
- Test skyrockets during puberty and drops at about 1% every year post puberty.

Most male in the animal kingdom, specifically of the mammalian type, do not get to reproduce. This is an important piece of information as it is very different from the human way of things.

Females of these species are receptive to males having high testosterone. Higher levels of test correlate to access to females. A different way to look at it is that, males having high test will actually be more competitive with other males in order to reproduce.

Test promotes novelty seeking, reduces anxiety. **Test lowers stress and anxiety.** Pushes male to suffer more in pursuit of reproduction.

<u>Competitive environment itself increases androgen hormones.</u> Winning increases test, losing decreases test but competition itself increases test overall.

Increase in estrogen during certain days in menstrual cycle, promotes seeking of sex and reproduction.
This is very similar in males as well, high test leads to high libido as well.

An obvious question would be now, **does sex itself increases testosterone?** : The answer is complicated. It will as long as the male ejaculates.
Interestingly, observing porn has a very modest increase in test. While having real sex increased test by about 70%. The twist is, abstinence, is seen to increase test by up to 400%. So the answer to the original question is very nuanced.

### Behaviors That decrease test

- Expecting fathers, are seen to have a significant decrease in test and cortisol levels - the stress hormone.
- Illness. But why? Illness, we make a lot of inflammatory cytokines. Such cytokine when present decrease sex seeking, independent of feeling lousy or "sick" at all. An example of pro inflammatory cytokine is IL-06, an example of anti inflammatory cytokine is IL-10.

### How exactly does Behavior change hormone?

Smell is really important in this context and possibly even pheromones.

Bruce effect - A pregnant animal will absorb or abort her fetus, if the dad of those animals is absent and a novel male is placed in her vicinity for 48 hours. Pheromones in the male urine are responsible for this.

Vandenburg Effect - Puberty in females can be accelerated by placing a novel sexually competent male. Another one is that if you place pre-pubescent females in vicinity of mature females that have already undergone puberty fully, it will cause a delay in the onset of puberty in such females.
