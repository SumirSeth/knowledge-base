- Ideas come first..!
- The startup should feel like a mission.

The problem with great startup ideas is that they seem to be bad in the beginning. If they looked good, everyone would be working on them. But they don't.
- You need conviction in your own beliefs.

The truly good ideas don't sound like they are worth stealing, such as, sharing your ideas isn't really an issue.

The really important advantage a student has is that students usually have better intuition than others on which markets would probably grow.

- Ask why now?

Clones of other successful companies with some differentiators is usually not a good idea for the long term. These businesses usually will collapse when the original company improves their product.

<span style="color:rgb(42, 190, 134)">Important:</span> While you are a student:
- Think about new ideas. :star:
- **Meet potential co-founders.**

### Takeaway:
Have a really really good understanding of the market. Try to follow the *changing trends* washing through the customers.
- Great Idea >> Great Product >> Great Company.
- Build something users love, not just *like*.
- It is better to have a product that a small group of people *love* instead of a product that a large group of people *like*.
- It is much easier to expand from small group of people that love what you are doing to a large group of people that love what you are doing.
- Word of mouth is really important, especially for organic growth.
- Simple is really good. It forces you to do the one thing you are doing, really really good.
- Show your product to people >> User Feedback >> Improve your product.


#### Metrics: Focus on growth.
- Total registrations
- Active users
- Activity Levels
- Cohort Retention
- Revenue
- Net Promoter Score

## Why start a startup?

Don't fall into the common reasons to become a tech entrepreneur: 

- It's glamorous
- You'll be the boss
- Flexibility
- You'll make more money and somewhat fame.

Starting and building a company very stressful. You have a huge responsibility to follow up to.
There definitely an ugly side to all of this.

#### People.

People are your boss as a CEO. Not just customers, but everyone involved is important to you.

#### Flexibility

- You're always on call
- You're a role model
- You're always working anyway

#### Impact and Money

A fallacy is that as an entr. you'll make more money and impact. this is for the most time, not truly the scenario.

### Best Reason to do it?

You can't not do it! You feel like you are perfect person to be doing this. You have the passion for it.

More importantly, the ==world needs you to do it==. If it doesn't, go do something the world *needs* you to do.

### Book Recommendations from Lecture 1:
