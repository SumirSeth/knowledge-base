> <u>Note to reader</u>: The content below will often use terms like abusers and empaths; note that these terms are contextual and are not used to demean humans and neither to put them on a pedestal. Everybody has their own struggles.

# <u>Letting go of fixing people</u>: *Abuser* vs *Boundless Empath*.

### Philosophical Aspects:

1. **<u>Existentialism</u>** : Existentialism emphasizes on individual freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. Hence, allowing other to make the choice even if it may result in particular negative consequences.
2. **<u>Meta Physics</u>** : The nature of reality. The limitations of our understanding of other people's experiences. *It emphasizes on the fact that one can never truly understand or control inner lives of others.*

>  <u>Note to Self</u>: Lifetime passes and it is still not sufficient to know a specific person 100% in and out.

3. **<u>Interdependence vs Co-dependence</u>** : Dangers of blurring boundaries; losing one's own self in trying to "fix" others.

## <sub>1</sub> the desire to fix

Usually around abusers, people in their normal state tend to rush to help and love. This is normal and very humane.

But often, empaths or boundless empaths if i say so, shower eternal love and care to these people in a hope to counter-act the negatives.

What ends up happening is quite the irony though, as the empaths usually do not have a clear idea of how deep the cut is in the abusers.

Individuals drive themselves to *exhaustion*, trying to fix and help. 



## <sub>2</sub> how change happens â€” or is avoided

<u>keyword</u>: intransigent

People like therapists and genuine care-offerors have to be careful while dealing with such people.

How change happens (or is avoided) is to a large extent dependent on the person wanting to *change*.

The role of care-offerors should have been to be of someone that gives an extra perspective on things and subtly guides the one in need until they can stand on their own.

What some in need won't realize is that if there is a want in them for the helpers to carry them on their shoulders, it would have zero healthy returns.

Even such, abusers insist they care-giver carries them on their back until the care-giver is exhausted.

Change in such people only happens through intent. thinking, making difficult choices, making tradeoffs, and accepting unfavorable outcomes.

Even if the care-offeror carries them on their back, what they fail to realize is that skipping the path of personal development has landed them at square zero. They are just as vulnerable, unequipped to deal with situations as they were before getting a ride on the back.

<u>key idea</u>: *a magical solution to a deeply entangles crisis*

Another situation is when people want others to change. This idea totally skips upon the personal development of themselves, not to mention one can not change another person purely by longing for it.



## <sub>3</sub> how empath and narcissists enter gridlock

There is a spectrum of narcissistic traits, ranging from malignant to mild. "hope" of change tails off as one goes from mild to the other side of the spectrum, even quite exponentially.

On the extreme side of traits being malignant, you are no longer looking at a human as we recognize it. You are looking at someone with a suit of armor.

All of us carry an armor, in healthier situations though, this armor is flexible. Adapting to different situations as it suits.

On the contrary, narcissists wear armor that is undistinguishable from human flesh. Carrying it around, protecting themselves from fear - fear of rejection, fear of facing their inner hollow self.

Change is unthinkable here.

<u>key idea</u>: armoring one self with a false image of ideological perfection.



Individuals who have succumbed to narcissistic people in their formative years, suffer from a lost image of self.

While narcissistic people raise *themselves* above everyone, showcasing superiority, these people who no longer have a definitive image of self, raise others around them, in turn lowering themselves from others. These people become *fixers, people pleasers, co-dependents*. Turning themselves into whatever others want them to be.

They are melting wax, shape shifting to whatever people want them to be.

They've been trained to be responsible for other people, to fix them, to be givers.

This is in stark contrast to narcissists who wear full armor, these people have no armor, even as far as to say, no flesh.

<u>key idea</u>: vulnerability acts like a shining beacon to emotional predators.

<span style="opacity:30%">*important discourse ahead*</span>

Malignant narcissists are like black holes, while boundless empaths are like shining stars. What is unfortunate is that, these black holes only see the shining star as a way to eat all the light of the star and satiate their hunger levels.

What is even more unfortunate is that those stars have no idea about the depth of the black hole. They rush with empathy to provide a beam of love and care in hopes of filing the black hole.

For the black hole, the shining star is just another target, once exhausted, the hole will find a new a target, without fail.



## <sub>4</sub> sympathy, empathy and over-identification
