# <u>Letting go of fixing people</u>: *Abuser* vs *Boundless Empath*.

### Philosophical Aspects:

1. **<u>Existentialism</u>** : Existentialism emphasizes on individual freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. Hence, allowing other to make the choice even if it may result in particular negative consequences.
2. **<u>Meta Physics</u>** : The nature of reality. The limitations of our understanding of other people's experiences. *It emphasizes on the fact that one can never truly understand or control inner lives of others.*

>  <u>Note to Self</u>: Lifetime passes and it is still not sufficient to know a specific person 100% in and out.

3. **<u>Interdependence vs Co-dependence</u>** : Dangers of blurring boundaries; losing one's own self in trying to "fix" others.
