# Magnetism Cheat Sheet

### Properties of Magnetic Lines

ML of Force is an imaginary line representing the direction of magnetic field such that the tangent at any point is the direction of the field vector at that point.

- Magnetic line form a closed path.

- Magnetic line are like strecthed elastic cord always trying to shorten themselves.

- Magnetic line which are parallel in the same direction repel each other.

### Magnetic Flux

- Symbol : $\phi$

- Total number of magnetic <u>field lines penetrating any surface placed perpendicular </u>to the magnetic field.

- $\phi = \int B.ds$

- Unit : Weber (Wb)

- <span style="color:yellow">Analogous to :</span> Electric Current

### Magnetic Flux Density

- Symbol = $B$

- Magnetic flux per unit area. <u>Density measured in context of area</u>.

- $B = \phi /A$

- Unit : Wb/m^2 (<u>Tesla</u>)

- <span style="color:yellow">Analogous to :</span> Current Density

### Magneto Motive Force

- Symbol : F

- <u>Force which drives the magnetic lines of force</u> through a magnetic circuit.

- $F = \phi \times S$
  $F = N \times I$

- Unit : AT (Ampere Turns)

- <span style="color:yellow">Analogous to :</span> EMF

### Magnetic Field Strength

- Symbol : H

- => Magnetic Field Strength. <u>Magneto motive force per unit length</u>.

- $H = (N \times I) / l$

- Unit : AT/m

- <span style="color:yellow">Analogous to :</span> Electric Field Strength

### Permeability

- Symbol : $\mu$

- Property of a material indicative of its ability to carry magnetic flux. Or, <u>a property of materials that measures how easily a magnetic field can pass through them</u>.

- $\mu = B / H$

- Unit : H/m

- Relative permeability : $\mu_r = \mu/\mu_0$ 

- <span style="color:yellow">Analogous to :</span> Conductivity

### Reluctance

- Symbol : S

- The measure of <u>opposition</u> the magnetic circuit offers to the flux.

- $S = \frac{l}{\mu_0\mu_rA}$

- <span style="color:yellow">Analogous to :</span> Resistance

### Direction of Mag Field

Use the right hand rule.

### Mag Field in a Solenoid

A coil of wire that acts as a magnet when an electric current flows through it.

$B = \frac{\mu_0NI}{l}$

![Solenoid Magnetic Field Gcse at Christine Davis blog](https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Solenoid-Magnetic-Field-Equation.jpg)

where n = N/l, n = turns per unit length

### Classification of Materials

- Linear 
  
  - Diamagnetic
  
  - Para

- Non Linear
  
  - Ferro

### Losses in Magnetic Circuit

- <u>**Hysteresis loss**</u> is caused due to *molecular friction* in a ferromagnetic material, under alternating magnetic field.
  
  - The energy dissipated as *heat* in the process of magnetisation and de-magnetisation.
  
  - This heat loss is proportional to the hysterisis loop area (obviously).

- <u>**Eddy Current Loss**</u> is the loss which is caused due to the induced current within a material. (In accordance to Faraday's Law of Induction)

### Major difference between Electric and Magnetic Circuit Analogies

- Current Actually flows. Magnetic flux does not *flow* in that sense.

- Current can NOT flow in air / vacuum. Flux *can* be created in air / vacuum.
