# How i am planning to tackle leetcode-ing and learn maximum from it.

On [Project 2025.](https://project2025-alpha.vercel.app/) (the place where i am tackling all the important things that i need to focus on this year) one of the mentioned point is to do leetcode daily. like how you would do maths. not maybe all day, but just enough, every single day.

==Consistency== is the exact thing i am looking for.

The article below will elaborate on how i am aiming to do exactly what the title says.

#### Focus on WHAT, WHY and HOW

## WHAT

- Doing a problem or two (if easy) daily right after college.

- Maintaining a log book that will contain:

  - Details of the problem i am doing, with time logging preferably.
  - Learnings from the problem solved.

## WHY

- Improving my general logic and coding ability.
- Preparing well in advance for the typical interview style questions so that i do not have to worry about it let's say 2 years down the lane.
- Again to emphasize, improving my logic and coding ability.

## HOW

- Consistently showing up everyday and focusing.
- No excuses.
- Doing it enough times that it becomes a habit.
- Reading (not watching yt videos) about the necessary knowledge required for solving a problem at hand.
