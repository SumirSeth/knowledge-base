# How i am planning to tackle leetcode-ing and learn maximum from it.

On [Project 2025.](https://project2025-alpha.vercel.app/) (the place where i am tackling all the important things that i need to focus on this year) one of the mentioned point is to do leetcode daily. like how you would do maths. not maybe all day, but just enough, every single day.

==Consistency== is the exact thing i am looking for.

The article below will elaborate on how i am aiming to do exactly what the title says.

(todo)
