# Social Media Over Consumption - Its affects on dopamine signaling and boredom as a tool to leverage natural dopamine reception.

## Common Sources of Dopamine that may or may not be obvious.

- Instagram / TikTok / Shorts and similar kinds of "infinite scrolling" based applications.
- Short form content with hyper attention grabbing mechanisms like bright colors, fast editing and sound effects.
- Junk Food
- Sugar
- Porn - Especially soft porn (very prominent on Instagram)
- Drugs / Alcohol

Some partially obvious ones:

- Learning hell. Learning things but not applying it. 
- Over - optimization ( Obsession over productivity apps, habit tracking etc, instead of doing things )
- Always on alert for checking notifications.
- Multitasking.

Some lesser obvious ones:

- Excessive day dreaming and fantasizing.
- Anticipation of future rewards. Ties well with the above point.
- Gossip and drama.
- Over validation from others.
- Chess.

Some unexpected ones:

- Listening to music
- Shopping
- Planning but not doing.
- Checking likes and analytics.

**<u>Ultimately</u>**, the brain just seeks *novelty*. That is, it wants something new, a change. Even chasing dopamine detoxing in itself can become a high dopamine activity.

> Identify from the list (add more points if you can) the actions that act as triggers for the brain.

<personal>

For me, the problems are:

- Music
- YT Shorts/Reels on phone.
- Twitter ( Deactivated as of 22/2/25 )
- Insta ( Removed and no longer an issue )
- Chess
