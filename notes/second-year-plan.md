# Whiteboard for everything I am thinking in order to accelerate in the 2nd year and be able to take a drop in one year.



- A Table gpt gave me for the prompt : "what change do i have to bring in myself to be more suited for such things. i am usually pretty laid back, introverted mostly and i dont like "official" work like things and how pretentious people are and all the buttering that goes on." 

| Trait             | Present State                                       | Necessary Shift                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Disposition**   | Laid-back, passive                                  | **Active-seeker**: detect, track, pursue opportunities weekly. |
| **Social Bias**   | Avoidance of pretension, dislike of “official” tone | **Strategic mimicry**: adopt the necessary tone *without internalizing it*. |
| **Communication** | Reserved, introverted                               | **Targeted expression**: speak only where it converts to value (applications, emails, interviews). |
| **Workflow**      | Aversion to bureaucracy                             | **Systematization**: convert “official work” into repeatable templates and pipelines. |
| **Motivation**    | Undefined, self-contained                           | **Externalization of motive**: express your work in terms *they* value (impact, leadership, excellence). |
