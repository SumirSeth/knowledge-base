# <u>Three Colors—White </u>: *liberty*, equality, fraternity.

Kieślowski's attempt at encapsulating the colors and symbolic meaning of the French flag are far from perfect, which is not a bad thing by any means. *"White"*, the trilogy's attempt at *liberty*, does a weirdly good job at it. Notice the use of the word *weird*.

Karol Karol, the protagonist delivers an amazing performance and a rather powerful one all things considered. His story of going from nothing, broke and just divorced to being the talk of the town, becoming a successful businessman and in the end being able to lure his ex-wife back to his town should not be mistaken for being **empowering**. Rather, it is a play of ego covered with a blanket of pride.

In the end, does it matter?

And that's a question best answered by the viewer themselves. But the director does drop hints of key takeaways, primarily in the last couple of scenes. The heartless ex-wife realizes that she hasn't yet forgotten love, loving and being loved.

Karol gets his *"revenge"* in the end, but is seen standing with tears rolling down his eyes. Does that really count as *revenge*?

When personal ego and pride take a step back, love shines. This is liberating, this is ***liberty***.

In fact, the use of the word "weird" in the starting, begins to make more and more sense as the film approaches it's beautiful ending. ***Liberty*** shows up in such subtle ways throughout the film that one might even miss it if the viewer is not willing to look at and notice the intricacies.

A good watch for anyone wanting to grow out of the typical Bollywood drama fest.
