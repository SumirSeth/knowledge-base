# Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness

From my personal research over the past year or so, a lot of people suffer from metabolic issues that don't seem apparent unless carefully looked into by the individual. Each body is different, attributing to the complex permutations and combinations of lifestyle, genetics, diet, activeness etc, which makes it hard to suggest just one *perfect* solution to the problems people come up with relating to metabolism and/or thyroid gland. This motivates me to extend my knowledge about the thyroid gland and how it affects different parts of one's life. The book "**Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness**" hence, is something that got me very excited because it aligns with exactly what I was looking for when starting my quest for knowledge in this domain.

The text below is everything I found useful from the book, most importantly it consists of things I want the general masses to know.

> Of all the problems that can affect physical or mental health, none is more common than thyroid gland disturbance. None is more readily and inexpensively corrected. And none is more often untreated, and even un-suspected.

## `1.` The Many Faces of Thyroid Deficiency

The introduction to this chapter lists multiple cases where low thyroid activity might play a role in the listed conditions. I list three examples that struck me the most,

- A barren couple.
- A man or a woman in a state of severe mental depression.
- A middle-aged man who has managed to distinguish himself in his career by fighting all his life against his low energy reserve but now has become tired of fighting and convinced there must be some physical explanation for his problem even though none has ever been found and more than once he has been told to consult a psychiatrist and more than once has done so without benefit.

An severe hypo thyroid adult may have,

- A "moon shaped" face.
- Slow and thick speech.
- Weakness and listlessness to the point of apathy.

Severe hypo thyroid is rare, but mild or moderate hypothyroidism is far from rare. A common symptom is ***fatigue***. It can range from mild to severe. It comes slowly, which might cloak itself under normality for the individual.

Another source of confusion is the failure of standard thyroid function tests to detect thyroid abnormalities reliably.

> There is a definite range for normal basal temperature.
> Below that range, low thyroid function is indicated.

> And when patients with
> low basal temperature have had thyroid treatment, their
> symptoms have disappeared as their basal temperature
> has climbed.
